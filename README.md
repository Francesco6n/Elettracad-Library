# Elettracad-Library
This repository is for sharing all the blocks of Elettracad that I have drawn over the years and that I will continue to draw.

Feel free to use them and write to me for specific requests or information.

##How to use
Just put all the files inside the "ElettraCADai_User\E_Libraries\E_User_Electric" directory.
Enjoy!
